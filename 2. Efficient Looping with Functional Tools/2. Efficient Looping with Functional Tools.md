The use of quicksort and other built-in functional tools in Aiken helps maintain optimal sorting and searching within collections, which is essential for operations like showing the cheapest available NFTs, highest-bid auctions, etc.

# Cost Impact: 
    Optimized functional loops and sort methods reduce computation steps, significantly lowering transaction fees compared to manual sorting implementations.
